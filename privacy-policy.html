  <h1>PocketGuide Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    PocketGuide values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture for authentication purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your precise geographic location, both in the foreground and background, to provide navigation and location-based narration features. You can disable location access in your device settings, though certain features may stop working.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device identifiers (such as device ID and operating system version) to maintain app security, prevent abuse, and improve performance.</li>

  </ul>
