  obligation whatsoever, and any other losses or damages due to such failure shall be the sole responsibility of

  discharge of such claim.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo or designated
